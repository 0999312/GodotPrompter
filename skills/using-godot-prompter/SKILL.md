# Using GodotPrompter

GodotPrompter provides Godot 4.x domain-specific skills for AI coding agents. Skills cover project setup, architecture patterns, gameplay systems, UI, multiplayer, testing, and deployment — for both GDScript and C#.

## How to Access Skills

**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool with the skill name (e.g., `Skill: "godot-prompter:state-machine"`).

**In Copilot CLI:** Use the `skill` tool. Skills are auto-discovered from installed plugins.

**In Gemini CLI:** Use the `activate_skill` tool. See `references/gemini-tools.md` for tool mapping.

**In Cursor:** Skills are loaded via custom instructions / rules system.

## Workflow: From Idea to Working Game

GodotPrompter handles the full development workflow. No other plugins required.

### 1. Design Phase
Load `godot-prompter:godot-brainstorming` — it guides you through:
- Asking clarifying questions about the game/system
- Proposing architectural approaches with trade-offs
- Designing scene trees, signal maps, and data flow
- Creating an implementation plan with ordered tasks

### 2. Implementation Phase
For each task in the plan, load the relevant domain skill:
- Building a player? Load `godot-prompter:player-controller` and `godot-prompter:state-machine`
- Adding inventory? Load `godot-prompter:inventory-system`
- Need save/load? Load `godot-prompter:save-load`

Each skill provides complete code examples, Godot best practices, and a checklist.

### 3. Review Phase
Load `godot-prompter:godot-code-review` to review the code against Godot-specific checklists.

### Agents
GodotPrompter provides 3 specialized agents (use via the Agent tool):
- **godot-game-architect** — Designs systems, plans scene trees, chooses patterns
- **godot-game-dev** — Implements features guided by skills
- **godot-code-reviewer** — Reviews code against Godot best practices

### Plan Storage
Implementation plans and design docs are saved to `docs/godot-prompter/plans/` and `docs/godot-prompter/specs/` in the user's project.

## Platform Adaptation

Skills use Claude Code tool names as the canonical reference. Non-Claude platforms: see the appropriate tool mapping file in `references/` for your platform's equivalents.
